Currently all processes occuring within the app are done locally, no backend server is used, and no accounts are required for using the app.

Camera access is required for taking pictures to be used for card detection (the main function of this app).

We might collect anonymous error logs data in the future, to better understand what might be going wrong out in the field. Also since this app is built in flutter, anonymous crash logs are sent to google for improving the framework.
